# Node.js

This a simple web application with Node.js, I decided to do this because I have interest in this kind of technology and I believe

that is the future.

This example was based in this brazilian [book](https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-nodejs) that teaches how to built a online chat, I recomend it. 

## App Features

1. Login Page
2. Main Page
3. Create User Page
4. Errors Page

## Database

1. MongoDB

### Ps:

There's no kind of authentication library, just a simple control with session.

Enjoy!
